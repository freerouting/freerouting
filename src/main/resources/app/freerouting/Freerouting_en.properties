English is set by default for unsupported languages.\n\n  -mt <number_of_threads>\n      Sets thread pool size for route optimization. The default is\n      one less than the number of logical processors in the system.\n\n  -us <updating_stratedy>\n      Greedy, Global, Hybrid. Sets board updating strategy for route\n      optimization. The default is greedy. When hybrid is selected,\n      another option "hr" specifies hybrid ratio.\n\n  -hr <m\:n>\n      Sets hybrid ratio in the format of\n      \#_global_optiomal_passes\:\#_prioritized_passes.\n      The default is 1\:1. It's only effective when hybrid strategy\n      is selected.\n\n  -is <selection_strategy>\n      Sequential, random, or prioritized. Sets item selection strategy\n      for route optimization\: sequential, random, prioritized. The \n      default is prioritized. Prioritied stragegy selects items based\n      on scores calculated in previous round.\n\n  -h Shows this help\n
