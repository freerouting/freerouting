# EasyEDA Freerouting Launcher

Freerouting Launcher is a legacy tool to launch freerouting in headless mode.

Also, it can emulate itself as a EasyEDA auto-router server.

EasyEDA developers are moving to Freerouting API use for better user experience.

See https://github.com/easyeda/eext-freerouting-intergration for details.
