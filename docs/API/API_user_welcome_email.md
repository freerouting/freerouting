Dear {{name}},

Welcome to the Freerouting API! We are thrilled to have you onboard as part of our growing community of PCB design enthusiasts and developers.

The Freerouting API provides advanced auto-routing capabilities for PCB layouts through a RESTful service, making it easy to integrate into your workflows.

Here’s a quick guide to help you get started:

### 1. Set HTTP headers for API Access

Make sure you have set the required HTTP headers: your **API key, Profile ID and Host** for each API call.

Include your API key in all requests using the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
Freerouting-Profile-ID: <PROFILE_ID>
Freerouting-Environment-Host: <HOST_NAME>/<HOST_VERSION>
```

**API Key:**
Your API key is a unique identifier that grants access to Freerouting API endpoints. Include it in the `Authorization`
header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

***Your API key is:*** `{{apiKey}}`

**Profile ID:**
The Profile ID identifies the user making the API call. This should be a valid GUID (e.g., `{{sampleUserId}}`).

- Use a unique Profile ID for each user if you have multiple users accessing the API.
- This helps organize and monitor API usage per user.

**Host Name and Version:**
The host name and version represent the software making the API call. Use the format:

```
Freerouting-Environment-Host: <SOFTWARE_NAME>/<VERSION>
```

Examples:

- `KiCad/8.0.6`
- `Firechip/3.1.3`
- `tscirciut/0.0.229`

### 2. Check the API Status

Test your connection by checking the system status endpoint:

```http
GET https://api.freerouting.app/v1/system/status
```

### 3. Start Your First Routing Job

The basic steps include:

- **Create a session:**
  ```http
  POST /sessions/create
  ```
- **Enqueue a routing job:**
  ```http
  POST /jobs/enqueue
  ```
- **Submit your input (DSN file):**
  ```http
  POST /jobs/{jobId}/input
  ```
- **Start the job:**
  ```http
  PUT /jobs/{jobId}/start
  ```
- **Retrieve the results (SES file):**
  ```http
  GET /jobs/{jobId}/output
  ```
